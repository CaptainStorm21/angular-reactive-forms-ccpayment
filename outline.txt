Needs to happen

      Forms need validations
      Forms need messaging to help the user along
      Forms frequently need to change rapidly without having to rewrite a ton of app logic
      Angular has 2 separate and different systems for building Forms
      We can technically implement forms with just what we've covered in this course so far(property binding even handlers)
