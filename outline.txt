### Needs to happen

      Forms need validations
      Forms need messaging to help the user along
      Forms frequently need to change rapidly without having to rewrite a ton of app logic
      Angular has 2 separate and different systems for building Forms
      We can technically implement forms with just what we've covered in this course so far(property binding even handlers)

### Reactive Forms

      Most of the form logic is driven by configuration in a component class file
      More appropriate for complex forms
      Exposes some aspects of the form to us as RxJS Observables
      We have to wire up the ReactiveFormsModule to our App Module to use them

### Template Forms

      Most of the form logic is driven by config in our component template file
      More appropriate for simple forms
      Harder to deal with dynamic forms (adding/removing form elements)
      We have to wire up FormsModule to our App Module to use them
